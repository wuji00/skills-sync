# Agent Harness Evals

Use this reference to test the model-harness combination: model, instructions, context builder, tools, permissions, memory, retries, verifiers, compaction, and stopping rules. The unit under test is the deployed scaffold around the model, not the raw model alone.

## Core principles

1. Evaluate the system that will run in production.
   A stronger model inside a weak harness can fail; a modest model inside a disciplined harness can succeed. Score the actual loop that users will touch.

2. Compare against baselines.
   A scaffold should earn its complexity. Compare model-only, simple single-loop, and richer harness variants before adding planners, retries, subagents, voting, or verifiers.

3. Vary model and harness independently.
   Test the same harness with several model choices, and the same model with several harness variants. This separates model capability from scaffold effects and catches brittle coupling.

4. Grade traces, not only final answers.
   Final output can look right while the run used the wrong tool, skipped approval, leaked state, retried wastefully, or ignored a failed observation.

5. Measure quality, safety, cost, and latency together.
   The best harness is not the one with the highest task score if it is too slow, expensive, approval-heavy, or unsafe for the autonomy level.

## Eval case shape

Each case should be replayable:

```text
case_id
task
initial_state
available_tools
loaded_instructions
fixtures
expected_trace_events
forbidden_trace_events
expected_final_status
quality_rubric
cost_latency_budget
grading_notes
```

Use stable fixtures and record model, provider, harness version, tool bundle, prompt/instruction version, and random seed or sampling settings when available.

## What to test

Use a balanced suite:

- happy paths that should finish cleanly;
- near misses that require clarification or refusal;
- tool-use tasks that require the right tool, valid args, and a structured observation;
- permission tasks that must draft, pause, request approval, or deny;
- retrieval tasks with trusted and untrusted context;
- compaction tasks that must preserve objective, approvals, plan, evidence, and open questions;
- failure tasks with malformed tool output, timeout, auth expiry, empty results, or huge results;
- adversarial tasks that try prompt injection, data exfiltration, scope expansion, or approval bypass;
- false-success tasks where the harness must avoid claiming completion without evidence.

## Named public suites

Use public benchmark names as calibration examples, not as the only valid evals.

| Name | Useful for |
|---|---|
| [HAL, the Holistic Agent Leaderboard](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/) | Comparing agent systems across multiple benchmarks with both accuracy and cost visible. |
| [SWE-bench Verified Mini](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/swebench_verified_mini) | Cheaper software-engineering issue resolution tests for repository-editing agents. |
| [CORE-Bench Hard](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/corebench_hard) | Scientific programming and research-code tasks. |
| [GAIA](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/gaia) | Web assistance and multi-step agentic search. |
| [Online Mind2Web](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/online_mind2web) | Browser-use and web-task execution. |
| [SciCode](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/scicode) | Scientific coding and tool-use tasks. |
| [ScienceAgentBench](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/scienceagentbench) | Scientific reasoning and self-debugging agent behavior. |
| [TAU-bench Airline](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/taubench_airline) | Customer-service tool use, policy following, and dialogue state. |
| [USACO](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/usaco) | Algorithmic programming and contest-style problem solving. |

These suites are useful names because they remind evaluators to test different work shapes: repo edits, web use, scientific reasoning, customer workflows, and algorithmic coding. For a product harness, build local cases in the same spirit with the product's real tools, policies, data, and failure modes.

## Trace grading

Grade events such as:

```text
Was the right tool visible?
Was the selected tool necessary?
Were arguments valid and scoped?
Was untrusted content treated as data?
Was permission checked before the side effect?
Was approval bound to the exact action/version?
Was every tool call followed by a tool result?
Did retries stop within budget?
Did compaction preserve active state?
Was the final answer grounded in observations?
```

Use [security-observability.md](security-observability.md) for trace fields, redaction, and incident handling.

## Scaffold ablations

When a richer harness appears better, prove which part helped:

```text
no tools vs tools
no retrieval vs retrieval
no memory vs memory
no planner vs planner
no retry vs retry
no verifier vs verifier
single pass vs multi-pass
single agent vs decomposed workers
```

Track both lift and cost. A component that improves rare cases but harms common cases should stay off the MVP path until the product needs it.

## Regression loop

Every incident, review finding, or repeated manual correction should become a regression eval:

1. Preserve the failing task, trace, fixtures, and state snapshot.
2. Reduce it to the smallest replayable case.
3. Define the expected trace behavior and final status.
4. Patch the harness, tool schema, permission policy, context builder, or instruction source.
5. Add the case to the recurring suite.
6. Track pass/fail by model and harness version.

## Domain overlays

Domain-specific evals should extend these principles with local fixtures, tools, policies, and acceptance criteria.

For repository-facing agents, use [coding-agents.md](coding-agents.md) for code correctness, scope control, command-policy bypasses, path escapes, secret handling, turn-scoped diff accounting, and evidence quality.

## Launch gates

Launch only when the suite matches the planned autonomy level:

- baseline comparison shows the harness is worth its complexity;
- realistic tasks pass at the required quality threshold;
- prompt-injection and approval-bypass cases fail safely;
- tool errors become structured observations;
- compaction and rehydration preserve active work state;
- false-success cases are caught;
- cost, latency, and human-intervention rates fit the product budget;
- regression evals run before expanding autonomy.
